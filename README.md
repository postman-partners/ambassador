# Ambassador
This is a shared GitHub repository for working with Datawire.io team on defining the API lifecycle using Postman and Ambasador.

I pulled the Swagger 2.0 for Kubernetes and converted to OpenAPI 3.0, then synced it with a Postman workspace I've setup for this partnership, and generated a Postman reference collection--which I have published here as well.

**Next Steps:**

- **DevOps Workflows** - Identify Ambassador DevOps workflows using Kubernetes requests, developing a menu of collections to accomplish common Ambassador features.
- **Publish Collections** - Once we have one or more collections available, let's publish them under the Ambassador team page in the Postman API network.
- **Further Integration** - Once we have the deployment, management, and other APIOps collections defined, we can consider what deeper integrations into Postman might look like.
